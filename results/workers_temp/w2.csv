Company Profile                   Company Profile  Amarin Corporation plc is a rapidly growing, innovative pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapeutics to cost-effectively improve cardiovascular health. Amarin’s lead product, VASCEPA® (icosapent ethyl) capsules, is available by prescription in the United States and an increasing number of other countries. For more information about VASCEPA® visit www.vascepa.com. This drug’s approval was expanded in 2019 as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in certain adults with elevated triglyceride levels of 150 milligrams per deciliter or higher and other cardiovascular risk factors. VASCEPA® (icosapent ethyl), capsules, was originally approved in 2012 to reduce severely elevated levels of triglycerides (500 milligrams per deciliter or higher), along with diet and exercise, in adult patients. This is the first and only FDA approved drug to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with elevated triglyceride levels as an add-on to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

Aemetis is seeking to commercialize the conversion of first generation biodiesel and ethanol plants into integrated production facilities that produce an expanded portfolio of higher value products, such as renewable jet fuel, renewable diesel, renewable chemicals, as well as valuable products from liquefied CO2. Aemetis has received $39 million in EB-5 funding and has $166 million in revenues. The company is publicly traded on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbol AMTX.       Congres created the EB-5 program in 1990 to benefit the US economy and create new jobs by attracting investments from qualified foreign investors who were granted a path to US citizenship through an investment of $900,000 into a qualified project. We view the EB-5 program as a powerful tool with which we can invest in new technologies, expand the production of high-value products, and create jobs. We are very pleased about the positive momentum our EB-5 project has gained in the past year, and look forward to an expansion of our participation in the future.

Minimum 15 minutes delayed.                  Corporate Profile  We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel small molecule therapeutics to address acute organ injuries and fibrotic diseases. Our goal is to transform the treatment paradigm for patients suffering from these potentially life-threatening conditions for which there are no approved medicines or where existing approved medicines have limitations. Our lead product candidate, ANG-3777, is a hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) mimetic currently being evaluated evaluating in multiple acute organ injuries and related indications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) and injuries to other major organs, such as the lungs, central nervous system (CNS) and heart. Within AKI, we are currently evaluating ANG-3777’s ability to improve kidney function and reduce the severity of transplant-associated AKI, also known as delayed graft function, in patients at risk for kidney dysfunction, as well as for the treatment of AKI associated with cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass. We are also evaluating ANG-3777 for indications within acute lung injury, with our primary focus on acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as acute CNS injuries. We are advancing multiple programs for the treatment of fibrotic diseases, leading with ANG-3070, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), and our inhibitor of rho kinase 2 (ROCK2). We also continue to develop other preclinical product candidates, including our CYP11B2 aldosterone synthase inhibitors, which we are investigating for the purpose of targeting aldosterone-related fibrotic diseases.

Our pipeline is based on our platform technology addressing well-researched classical complement-mediated autoimmune and neurodegenerative disease processes, both of which are triggered by aberrant activation of C1q, the initiating molecule of the classical complement pathway. Evidence suggests that potent and selective inhibition of C1q can prevent tissue damage triggered in antibody-mediated autoimmune disease and preserve loss of functioning synapses associated with cognitive and functional decline in complement-mediated neurodegeneration. Our pipeline of product candidates is designed to block the activity of C1q and the entire classical complement pathway in a broad set of complement-mediated diseases. Our current development portfolio can be found here. Based on learnings from our initial trials, we are advancing our current programs while evaluating additional orphan and large market indications.

Willis Towers Watson shareholders should seek advice from an independent financial advisor as to the suitability of any action for the shareholder concerned.  OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS The release, publication or distribution of the Information in or into jurisdictions other than Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States may be restricted by law and therefore any persons who are subject to the law of any jurisdiction other than Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States should inform themselves about, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. In particular the ability of persons who are not resident in Ireland, the United Kingdom or the United States, to vote their Willis Towers Watson shares with respect to the scheme of arrangement to effect the Proposed Combination (the “Scheme”) at the Willis Towers Watson court meeting, or to appoint another person as proxy to vote at the Willis Towers Watson court meeting on their behalf, may be affected by the laws of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are located. Any failure to comply with the applicable restrictions may constitute a violation of the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the companies and persons involved in the Proposed Combination disclaim any responsibility or liability for the violation of such restrictions by any person.  The Information has been prepared for the purpose of complying with the laws of Ireland and the Irish Takeover Rules and the information disclosed may not be the same as that which would have been disclosed if the Information had been prepared in accordance with the laws of jurisdictions outside of Ireland. Unless otherwise determined by Aon or required by the Irish Takeover Rules, and permitted by applicable law and regulation, the Proposed Combination will not be made available directly or indirectly, in, into or from any jurisdictions in which the release, publication or distribution of the Information may be restricted by the laws of those jurisdictions (where to do so would violate the laws in that jurisdiction (a “Restricted Jurisdiction”) and no person may vote in favour of the Proposed Combination by any such use, means, instrumentality or form within a Restricted Jurisdiction or any other jurisdiction if to do so would constitute a violation of the laws of that jurisdiction. Copies of the Information and any formal documentation relating to the Proposed Combination will not be and must not be, directly or indirectly, mailed or otherwise forwarded, distributed or sent in, into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction or any jurisdiction where to do so would violate the laws of that jurisdiction and persons receiving such documents (including custodians, nominees and trustees) must not mail or otherwise forward, distribute or send them in or into or from any Restricted Jurisdiction. Doing so may render invalid any related purported vote in respect of the Proposed Combination. If the Proposed Combination is implemented by way of a takeover offer (unless otherwise permitted by applicable law or regulation), the takeover offer may not be made, directly or indirectly, in or into or by use of the mails or any other means or instrumentality (including, without limitation, facsimile, email or other electronic transmission, telex or telephone) of interstate or foreign commerce of, or any facility of a national, state or other securities exchange of any Restricted Jurisdiction and the takeover offer will not be capable of acceptance by any such use, means, instrumentality or facilities or from within any Restricted Jurisdiction. The availability of new Aon shares under the Proposed Combination to Willis Towers Watson shareholders who are not resident in Ireland, the United Kingdom or the United States or the ability of those persons to hold such shares may be affected by the laws or regulatory requirements of the relevant jurisdictions in which they are resident. Persons who are not resident in Ireland, the United Kingdom or the United States should inform themselves of, and observe, any applicable legal or regulatory requirements. The new Aon shares have not been, and will not be, registered under applicable securities laws of any state, province, territory or jurisdiction of Canada, Australia or Japan, the relevant clearances have not been, and will not be, obtained from the securities commission of any province of Canada and no prospectus in relation to the new Aon shares has been, or will be, lodged with, or registered by, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission or the Japanese Ministry of Finance. Accordingly, the new Aon shares may not (unless an exemption under the relevant securities Laws is applicable) be offered, sold, resold, delivered or transferred, directly or indirectly, in or into Canada, Australia or Japan or any other jurisdiction if to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of, or require registration thereof in, such jurisdiction or to, or for the account or benefit of, a person located in Canada, Australia or Japan. Further details in relation to overseas shareholders will be contained in the joint proxy materials to be jointly prepared and filed with SEC by Willis Towers Watson and Aon in relation to the Proposed Transaction (which will include the Scheme document) (the “Joint Proxy Statement”).

NO OFFER OR SOLICITATION This communication is for information purposes only and is not intended to and does not constitute, or form part of, an offer, invitation or the solicitation of an offer or invitation to purchase, otherwise acquire, subscribe for, sell or otherwise dispose of any securities, or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction, pursuant to the proposed combination or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. In particular, this communication is not an offer of securities for sale into the United States. No offer of securities shall be made in the United States absent registration under the U.S. Securities Act or pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, such registration requirements. Any securities issued as a result of the proposed combination by means of a scheme of arrangement are anticipated to be issued in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to the exemption from registration set forth in Section 3(a)(10) thereof. Subject to the provisions of the business combination agreement entered to into between Aon and WTW and with the Irish Takeover Panel’s consent, the proposed combination will be implemented solely by means of the scheme documentation, which contains the full terms and conditions of the proposed combination, including details of how shareholders of Aon and WTW may vote in respect of the proposed combination. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This communication contains certain statements that are forward-looking, as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations of management about future events. Forward-looking statements can often, but not always, be identified by the use of words such as “plans,” “expects,” “is subject to,” “budget,” “scheduled,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “potential,” “continue,” “intends,” “anticipates,” “believes” or variations of such words, and statements that certain actions, events or results “may,” “could,” “should,” “would,” “might” or “will” be taken, occur or be achieved. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to be correct. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the proposed combination will not be consummated, failure to obtain necessary shareholder or regulatory approvals or to satisfy any of the other conditions to the proposed combination, adverse effects on the operating results and/or the market price of securities of Aon and/or WTW for any reason, including, without limitation, because of the failure to consummate the proposed combination, the failure to realize the expected benefits of the proposed combination (including anticipated revenue and growth synergies), the failure to effectively integrate the combined companies following consummation of the proposed combination, negative effects of an announcement of the proposed combination, changes in global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax laws, regulations, rates and policies, future business acquisitions or disposals, or any announcement relating to the consummation of or failure to consummate the proposed combination on the market price of securities of Aon and/or WTW, significant transaction and integration costs or difficulties in connection with the proposed combination and/or unknown or inestimable liabilities, litigation associated with the proposed combination, the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of the proposed combination on relationships, including with suppliers, customers, employees and regulators, and general economic, business and political conditions (including any epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreak, such as COVID-19) that affect the combined companies following the consummation of the proposed combination. The factors identified above are not exhaustive. Aon, WTW and their respective subsidiaries operate in a dynamic business environment in which new risks may emerge frequently. Other unknown or unpredictable factors could also cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements should therefore be construed in the light of such factors. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Further information concerning Aon and its businesses, including economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, technological and other factors that could materially affect Aon’s results of operations and financial condition, is contained in Aon’s filings with the SEC. See Aon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2020, Aon’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on May 1, 2020, and additional documents filed by Aon with the SEC for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to Aon’s businesses. Further information concerning WTW and its businesses, including economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, technological and other factors that could materially affect WTW’s results of operations and financial condition, is contained in WTW’s filings with the SEC. See WTW’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020, WTW’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on April 30, 2020 and additional documents filed by WTW with the SEC for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to WTW’s businesses. Any forward-looking statements in this communication are based upon information available as of the date of this communication which, while believed to be true when made, may ultimately prove to be incorrect. Other than in accordance with legal or regulatory obligations, neither Aon nor WTW is under any obligation, and each expressly disclaims any intention or obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Aon, WTW and/or any person acting on behalf of either of them are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. PARTICIPANTS IN THE SOLICITATION Aon, WTW and their respective directors and executive officers may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies from shareholders in connection with the proposed combination. Information regarding the persons who may, under the rules of the SEC, be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of shareholders, including a description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, is set forth in the definitive joint proxy statement. Additional information about Aon’s directors and executive officers is contained in Aon’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 14, 2020, and Aon’s Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, dated and filed with the SEC on April 24, 2020. Additional information about WTW’s directors and executive officers is contained in WTW’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020, and WTW’s Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A, dated and filed with the SEC on April 27, 2020. IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC AND WHERE TO FIND IT Aon and WTW have prepared and distributed a joint proxy statement (containing the scheme documentation) to shareholders of Aon and WTW, containing further information relating to the implementation of the proposed combination, the full terms and conditions of the scheme, notices of the shareholders meetings of Aon and WTW and information on the Class A ordinary shares of Aon to be issued under the proposed combination. The definitive joint proxy statement was filed with the SEC on July 8, 2020. The definitive proxy statement, when filed, as well as Aon’s and WTW’s other public filings with the SEC, may be obtained without charge at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and, in the case of Aon’s filings, at Aon’s website at ir.aon.com, and in the case of WTW’s filings, at WTW’s website at investors.willistowerswatson.com. BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING DECISION, HOLDERS OF SECURITIES OF AON AND/OR WTW ARE URGED TO READ THOSE FILINGS AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS FILED OR TO BE FILED WITH THE SEC IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED COMBINATION, INCLUDING ANY DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE THEREIN, CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSED COMBINATION AND THE PARTIES THERETO. Any vote in respect of resolutions to be proposed at the WTW shareholders meetings to approve the proposed combination, the scheme or related matters, or other responses in relation to the proposed combination, should be made only on the basis of the information contained in the joint proxy statement (including the scheme documentation). Similarly, any vote in respect of resolutions to be proposed at the meeting of Aon’s shareholders to approve the issuance of Class A ordinary shares of Aon under the proposed combination should be made only on the basis of the information contained in the joint proxy statement (including the scheme documentation). NO PROFIT FORECAST / ASSET VALUATIONS  No statement in the Information is intended to constitute a profit forecast for any period, nor should any statements be interpreted to mean that earnings or earnings per share will necessarily be greater or lesser than those for the relevant preceding financial periods for Aon or Willis Towers Watson as appropriate. No statement in the Information constitutes an asset valuation. CONFIRMATION OF UNDERSTANDING AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIS NOTICE By clicking on “I agree” below, you confirm that you have read, understood and agreed to be bound by the terms of the notice set out above and that you are not in, or a resident of, any jurisdiction where to download or view the Information would constitute a breach of securities law or regulation in that jurisdiction. If you click “I disagree” below, we will be unable to provide you with access to the Information and you will be redirected to Aon’s homepage. Subject to any continuing obligations under applicable law or any relevant regulatory requirements, Aon expressly disclaims any obligation to disseminate, after the date of the posting of any document or announcement on this website, any updates or revisions to any statements in such documents or announcements in relation to the Proposed Combination to reflect any change in expectations or events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements are based. If you are in any doubt about the contents of the Information or this section of the website or the action you should take, you should seek your own financial advice from an appropriately authorised independent financial adviser.

Looking into the future, Air Products sees significant opportunities in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen for energy to help solve the world’s urgent sustainability challenges.

APSG is the first SPAC vehicle fully supported by Apollo and its leadership at the GP level and seeks to invest in a growth-oriented, public-ready company with strong business fundamentals, a market-leading position and an established business model in an industry with robust secular tailwinds.   APSG’s size presents a competitive advantage, enabling it to deploy significant capital to partner with a management team and business that has the scale and infrastructure to be a compelling publicly listed company in the U.S. APSG provides a distinct opportunity for public investors to invest in an Apollo-sponsored vehicle that seeks to create long-term shareholder value. Unmatched Investment Platform Apollo has a 30+ year history of successfully creating value across various market cycles and asset classes, and APSG extends Apollo’s investment management capabilities to public-ready, growth-oriented companies. Establishing a business to invest in this opportunity set is consistent with Apollo’s track record of expanding its platform and investment management capabilities into new areas that complement the firm’s existing strategies. Apollo is led by managing partners Leon Black, Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan, who have worked together for more than three decades and lead a team of over 1,500 employees, including more than 500 investment professionals, in New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Houston, Bethesda, London, Frankfurt, Luxembourg, Madrid, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, Tokyo, Delhi and Mumbai. Apollo’s three primary business segments (Private Equity, Credit and Real Assets) operate in a fully integrated manner with no information barriers. APSG benefits from this connectivity and culture of collaboration, which generates countless proprietary investment opportunities through Apollo’s extensive global network. We believe this association with the broader Apollo platform and its unique sourcing engine will enable APSG to identify attractive investment opportunities that fit its criteria. Value-Added Expertise Through insights derived from its integrated platform and ownership of more than 170 private equity portfolio companies since inception, Apollo has significant experience finding many paths to value and identifying, supporting and accelerating growth in businesses – many of which have transitioned successfully to the public markets, where they have continued to outperform. Apollo is a long-term builder of businesses in partnership with strong management teams. Its approach to value creation is embodied in its in-house Apollo Portfolio Performance Solutions (APPS) team that leverages the firm’s platform, knowledge and institutionalized best practices to drive impact related to operational and commercial excellence, technology and analytics, environmental, social and governance measures and other strategic initiatives. These deep functional capabilities have helped Apollo generate industry-leading returns in its private equity segment for more than three decades. APSG benefits from Apollo’s scale and reach, as one of the largest alternative credit asset managers and a leading participant in the leveraged finance markets. We believe Apollo’s proven ability to assist high-quality companies with structuring, providing and sourcing capital to support growth is a distinct advantage of partnering with APSG. APSG is a compelling opportunity for prospective public-ready companies seeking a value-added partner with a sponsor that has a track record of success.    show more             Management and Board of Directors   Sanjay Patel, Chief Executive Officer  Mr. Patel serves as our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors.

No personally identifiable data or information will be shared with advertisers or partners without your permission. Some of your information may be shared on an aggregate basis only, as part of a larger set of statistics (for example, statistics that indicate the percentage of our members that are female), but that information will not be sufficient to permit the recipient to identify you. Except as otherwise provided, we will only disclose personally identifiable data without your permission in the following limited circumstances: (i) if we are required to do so by law, or (ii) if we have the good faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to applicable laws or comply with legal process served on us, or to protect and defend this site’s rights or property or the rights or property of an account holder of this site.

Our revolutionary modular AquaRefining recycling technology is cleaner, more cost effective and energy efficient, and produces ultra-pure lead to modernize an important global recycling activity in a socially responsible manner. Lead is the most recycled material in the world. All lead acid battery recycling currently utilizes lead smelting, a high temperature thermal reduction process which generates toxic liquid, gases and particulate waste which it is difficult and expensive to manage. In the US many lead smelters have failed to meet environmental standards. In less regulated countries smelters operate with limited environmental safeguards. As such lead smelting is often listed in the World's top 5 most polluting industries. Our world deserves better. AquaMetals makes the highest purity lead cost effectively - without pollution.

Investors Overview                    Aravive, Inc. is a clinical-stage oncology company developing innovative therapeutics to treat life-threatening diseases. Aravive’s lead therapeutic, AVB-500, is a first-in-class ultra-high affinity decoy protein that targets the GAS6-AXL signaling pathway associated with tumor cell growth, tumor metastasis, resistance to treatment and decreased survival. AVB-500 has the potential to be combined with multiple anti-cancer therapies across several tumor types, due to its novel mechanism of action and favorable safety profile. AVB-500 has been granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in platinum resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. The Company is currently evaluating AVB-500 in a registrational Phase 3 trial in platinum resistant ovarian cancer and a Phase 1b/2 trial in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Aravive plans to initiate the Phase 1b portion of a Phase 1b/2 trial evaluating AVB-500 in first-line treatment of pancreatic cancer in the second half of 2021.

Side effects can be severe, however, leading to pain, alterations in normal body functions (for example, urinary or salivary function), deterioration of quality of life, permanent injury and even death. Side effects can occur during or shortly after radiation treatment or in the months and years following radiation. The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient’s general medical condition, to name a few. For more details about the side effects of your radiation therapy, and if treatment with an Accuray product is right for you, ask your doctor.                 ","",""

The majority of Aridis’ product candidates are derived by employing a differentiated antibody discovery platform called MabIgX. The proprietary product pipeline is comprised of fully human mAbs targeting specific pathogens associated with life‑threatening bacterial infections, primarily hospital‑acquired pneumonia, or HAP, and ventilator‑associated pneumonia, or VAP. Three of these product candidates have exhibited promising preclinical data and clinical data are available from two completed studies and are in pivotal trial stage. The Company’s lead product candidate, AR‑301 targets the alpha toxin produced by gram‑positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, or S. aureus, a common pathogen associated with HAP and VAP. Aridis conducted an end‑of‑Phase 2 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and expect to initiate a Phase 3 pivotal trial for AR‑301 in the second half of 2018.

Forward-looking statements include those containing such words as ""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" ""could,"" ""estimates,"" ""expects,"" ""forecasts,"" ""goal,""      ""guidance,"" ""intends,"" ""may,"" ""outlook,"" ""plans,"" ""projects,"" ""seeks,"" ""sees,"" ""should,"" ""targets,"" ""will,"" ""would,"" or other words of similar meaning. All statements that      reflect Arconicâs expectations, assumptions or projections about the future, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, forecasts and      expectations relating to the growth of end markets; statements and guidance regarding future financial results or operating performance; statements regarding future strategic actions, which may be      subject to market conditions, legal requirements and other considerations; and statements about Arconic's strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects. These statements reflect beliefs and      assumptions that are based on Arconicâs perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors Arconic believes are appropriate in the circumstances.      Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict, which could cause actual results to differ      materially from those indicated by these statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: (a)  the impact of the separation on the businesses of Arconic; (b) the risk that the separation may      be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected, which could result in additional demands on Arconicâs resources, systems, procedures and controls, disruption of its ongoing business, and diversion of managementâs      attention from other business concerns; (c) the possible impacts and our preparedness to respond to implications of COVID-19 (d) deterioration in global economic and financial market conditions generally; (e) unfavorable changes      in the markets served by Arconic; (f) the inability to achieve the level of revenue growth, cash generation, cost savings, improvement in profitability and margins, fiscal discipline, or strengthening of competitiveness      and operations anticipated or targeted; (g) competition from new product offerings, disruptive technologies or other developments; (h) political, economic, and regulatory risks relating to Arconicâs global operations,      including compliance with U.S. and foreign trade and tax laws, sanctions, embargoes and other regulations; (i) manufacturing difficulties or other issues that impact product performance, quality or safety; (j) Arconicâs     inability to realize expected benefits, in each case as planned and by targeted completion dates, from acquisitions, divestitures, facility closures, curtailments, expansions, or joint ventures; (k) the impact of cyber      attacks and potential information technology or data security breaches; (l) the loss of significant customers or adverse changes in customersâ business or financial conditions; (m) adverse changes in discount rates or investment      returns on pension assets; (n) the impact of changes in aluminum prices and foreign currency exchange rates on costs and results; (o) the outcome of contingencies, including legal proceedings, government or regulatory      investigations, and environmental remediation, which can expose Arconic to substantial costs and liabilities; and (p) the other risk factors summarized in Arconicâs Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 and other      reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Market projections are subject to the risks discussed above and other risks in the market. Arconic disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly      any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.   Non-GAAP Financial Measures Some of the information included in this communication is derived from Arconicâs consolidated financial information but is not presented in Arconicâs financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the  United States of America (GAAP). Certain of these data are considered ânon-GAAP financial measuresâ under SEC rules. These non-GAAP financial measures supplement our GAAP disclosures and should not be considered an alternative to the  GAAP measure. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and managementâs rationale for the use of the non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the schedules to this communication.  Arconic has not provided a reconciliation of any forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures because Arconic is unable to quantify certain amounts  that would be required to be included in the GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, and Arconic believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading  to investors. In particular, reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not  available without unreasonable efforts due to the variability and complexity with respect to the charges and other components excluded from these non-GAAP measures, such as the effects of foreign  currency movements, equity income, gains or losses on sales of assets, taxes and any future restructuring or impairment charges. These reconciling items are in addition to the inherent variability  already included in the GAAP measures, which includes, but is not limited to, price/mix and volume.           About Us   Ethics and Compliance   Leadership   Arconic Foundation   Sustainability   History     ESG   Environmental   Social   Governance   Sustainability Report     What We Do   Aerospace & Defense   Automotive & Commercial Transportation   Building and Construction   Industrial Solutions   Spectrochemical Reference Materials     Investors   Events and Presentations   Earnings   Financial Releases   Environmental, Social and Governance   Corporate Governance   SEC Filings   Shareholder Services   Contact Investor Relations     Our Products Join Us News Contact      Privacy Cookie Settings Legal Notices Integrity Line Sitemap Copyright © 2021 Arconic                close      ","",""

Recently published mouse and human genetic data implicate the Angpt/Tie2 pathway in maintenance of Schlemm’s canal, a critical component of the conventional outflow tract. The Company’s lead compound, razuprotafib (formerly AKB-9778), a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of vascular endothelial protein tyrosine phosphatase (“VE-PTP”), is being developed as a potential treatment for open angle glaucoma, and the Company intends to investigate the therapeutic potential of razuprotafib in other indications. The Company is also evaluating development options for ARP-1536, a humanized monoclonal antibody, for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of diabetic vascular complications including nephropathy and diabetic macular edema (“DME”). The Company’s third asset is a bispecific antibody that binds both VEGF and VE-PTP which is designed to inhibit VEGF activation and activate Tie2. This bispecific antibody has the potential to be an improved treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration and DME via intravitreal injection. Finally, the Company has exclusively out-licensed AKB-4924 (now called GB004), a first-in-class small molecule inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF). GB004 is being developed by AKB-4924’s exclusive licensor, Gossamer Bio, Inc. (Nasdaq: GOSS). For more information, please visit www.aerpio.com.

Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, Arrowhead therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Arrowhead’s RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.

Ashland has identified some of these forward-looking statements with words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “expects,” “estimates,” “is likely,” “predicts,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “objectives,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “plans” and “intends” and the negative of these words or other comparable terminology. Ashland may from time to time make forward-looking statements in its annual reports, quarterly reports and other filings with the SEC, news releases and other written and oral communications. These forward-looking statements are based on Ashland’s expectations and assumptions, as of the date such statements are made, regarding Ashland’s future operating performance and financial condition, as well as the economy and other future events or circumstances. These statements include, but may not be limited to, Ashland’s assessment on its progress towards becoming a premiere specialty chemicals company and its expectations regarding its ability to drive sales and earnings growth, realize further cost reductions and complete the anticipated divestiture of its Composites business and Marl BDO facility. Ashland’s expectations and assumptions include, without limitation, internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends, management plans and strategies, operating efficiencies and economic conditions (such as prices, supply and demand, cost of raw materials, and the ability to recover raw-material cost increases through price increases), and risks and uncertainties associated with the following: the program to eliminate certain existing corporate and Specialty Ingredients expenses (including the possibility that such cost eliminations may not occur or may take longer to implement than anticipated), the expected divestiture of its Composites segment and the Marl BDO facility, and related merchant I&S products (including, in each case, the possibility that a transaction may not occur or that, if a transaction does occur, Ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transaction), the impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures Ashland has made or may make, including the acquisition of Pharmachem (including the possibility that Ashland may not realize the anticipated benefits from such transactions); Ashland’s substantial indebtedness (including the possibility that such indebtedness and related restrictive covenants may adversely affect Ashland’s future cash flows, results of operations, financial condition and its ability to repay debt); Ashland’s ability to generate sufficient cash to finance its stock repurchase plans; severe weather, natural disasters, cyber events and legal proceedings and claims (including product recalls, environmental and asbestos matters); and without limitation, risks and uncertainties affecting Ashland that are described in Ashland’s most recent Form 10-K (including Item 1A Risk Factors) filed with the SEC, which is available on Ashland’s website at http://investor.Ashland.com or on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. Various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, projected or implied by any forward-looking statements. Ashland believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. Unless legally required, Ashland undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this communication whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Important Information In connection with the forthcoming solicitation of proxies from stockholders in respect of Ashland’s 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Ashland will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) a proxy statement on Schedule 14A (the “proxy statement”), containing a form of white proxy card.

Investment Highlights   Investment Highlights Atlas Corp. (""Atlas"") is a leading global asset management company, differentiated by its position as a best-in-class owner and operator with a focus on deploying capital to create sustainable shareholder value. Atlas brings together an experienced asset management team with deep operational and capital allocation experience. We target long-term, risk adjusted returns across high quality infrastructure assets in the maritime sector, energy sector and other infrastructure verticals. Our two main portfolio companies, Seaspan and APR, are unique, industry-leading operating platforms in the global maritime and energy space.           Seaspan Corporation Seaspan is the largest independent owner and operator of containerships in the world, with an industry-leading, fully-integrated operating platform that delivers unique and differentiated value to our customers through a full life-cycle asset management approach.  Fully-integrated platform With an intense focus on operational excellence, Seaspan leverages the benefits of being an asset owner and operator to deliver a full suite of creative solutions to our customers – operationally, commercially and financially. Seaspan’s fully-integrated platform facilitates industry-leading safety performance, reliability and cost efficiency.  High-Quality Customer Partnerships and Resilient Business Model We charter our vessels primarily pursuant to long-term, fixed-rate time charters to the world’s leading container shipping liners, including long-term charters with seven of the eight top global liners. We have approximately $4.6 billion of long-term contracted revenue with an average remaining charter life of four years. Seaspan provides its customers with significant portions of their operating capacity. The trust our customers place in us is underpinned by our reputation for safety and reliability which we have built over the years. Financial Strength and Stability Seaspan’s balance sheet strength and financial liquidity allow us to pursue quality opportunities through thoughtful capital allocation. As of December 31, 2019 Seaspan has a total liquidity of $470 million and a pool of 32 unencumbered vessels, with $3.2 billion of shareholders’ equity.   APR Energy Ltd. APR provides rapidly deployable, large-scale power and fast-track mobile power to underserved markets and industries. Our mobile, turnkey power plants help run countries, cities and industries around the world in both developed and developing markets. We create unique value through delivering large-scale power projects anywhere in the world in significantly less time than the typical two to five years required to plan, finance, construct and commission a permanent power plant. We offer customized turnkey solutions including flexible plant design, fast-track installation, supply of balance of plant, and full decommissioning. Unique Assets with Contracted Cash Flows APR is the only global, at-scale operator of mobile gas turbines. The company is uniquely positioned to capitalize on both fast-track and long-term power generation opportunities as the leading owner and operator of an 850MW mobile gas turbine fleet, as well as a legacy fleet of ~700MW diesel/gas generators. APR’s strength as an operator providing fast, flexible, and fully-integrated global services supports the company’s long-term contracted cash flows. APR’s contract terms range from one to five years, which provide strong free cash flow yields across its deployed fleet. Global Macro Tailwinds APR operates against a compelling macro backdrop of growing emerging market demand for power. The transition to alternative and distributed power generation and power disruption from increasing incidences of natural disasters create an increased need for fasttrack power. APR’s operations in both developed and developing markets deliver solutions to meet these needs; we also allow for customers to use alternative fuels such as natural gas, LNG and LPG to replace aging infrastructure and provide our customers grid stability solutions for grids that rely on renewables.

Actinium’s lead application for our ARC’s is targeted conditioning, which is intended to selectively kill patient’s cancer cells and certain immune cells prior to a BMT or Bone Marrow Transplant, CAR-T and other cell therapies. With our ARC approach, we seek to improve patient outcomes and access to these potentially curative treatments by eliminating or reducing the non-targeted chemotherapy that is used for conditioning in standard practice currently. Our lead product candidate, Iomab-B is being studied in the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 Study of Iomab-B in Elderly Relapsed or Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (SIERRA) trial for BMT conditioning. Beyond Iomab-B, we are developing a multi-disease, multi-target pipeline of clinical-stage ARC’s targeting the antigens CD45 and CD33 for targeted conditioning and as a therapeutic either in combination with other therapeutic modalities or as a single agent for patients with a broad range of hematologic malignancies including AML or Acute Myeloid Leukemia, MDS or Myelodysplastic Syndrome MM or Multiple Myeloma. Underpinning our clinical programs is our proprietary AWE or Antibody Warhead Enabling technology platform. This is where our intellectual property portfolio of over 100 patents, know-how, collective research and expertise in the field are being leveraged to construct and study novel ARC’s and ARC combinations to bolster our pipeline and for strategic purposes. Our AWE technology platform is currently being utilized in a collaborative research partnership with Astellas Pharma, Inc.

"462","https://atrion.irpass.com/","[23:12:03]                                  Nasdaq: ATRI   Sectors:    Health Services       Medical Appliances & Equipment       Medical Instruments & Supplies      Investment Style:  Theme Value Alternative Cash Flow Growth    Highlights:   Atrions ability to generate strong cash flows is a key strength that enables the company to deliver consistent growth and profitability and to support ongoing R&D and capital improvements in technology, facilities and equipment.   Over the past several years, these investments included new manufacturing machinery and equipment that enhance our ability to meet customer needs with even greater quality, flexibility and efficiency.  Our consistent generation of cash flow also enables us to invest in value-creating initiatives such as stock repurchases and dividend payments.Despite fluctuations in markets, product demand, and the economy, the company has continued to return value to stockholders through consistent, strong earnings growth.  Over the past twenty-two years, Atrion attained annual compounded rates of growth of 6% in sales, 15% in operating income, and 18% in EPSall of which we achieved organically rather than through acquisitions.  During this same time period, the companys stock price increased from $8.00 per share to over $700 per share.Our return on equity has also steadily increased from five percent in 1999 to 13 percent in 2020.  From 1999 to 2020, we repurchased over two million shares of our stock and consistently executed the timely repayment of debt associated with these buybacks.  The Company has no outstanding debt as of December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020 our cash and investments totaled $87.9 million.   Summary:   Although Atrion is a relatively small company in the medical products arena, a number of our products hold leading market positions in their respective niches, creating a stable and diversified revenue base.  Atrions presence in the healthcare and medical products industry is based on providing devices and components to niche markets that offer significant opportunity for product development, market penetration and revenues growth. We work to enhance our position in the markets we serve by:  	Focusing on customer needs  	Expanding existing product lines and developing new products 	Maintaining a culture of controlling cost 	Preserving and fostering a collaborative, entrepreneurial management structure  As a result of this strategy, a number of our most successful products hold the leading market positions in their respective niches, demonstrating that small markets can produce attractive returns. For example, Atrion is a leading U.S. manufacturer of soft contact lens disinfection cases, clamps for IV sets, cardiac surgery vacuum relief valves, minimally invasive surgical tapes, check valves and balloon catheters for the treatment of tear duct blockages. Atrion is also the leading manufacturer of valves and inflation devices used in marine and aviation safety products.  To respond to new market opportunities, we make research and development a continuing priority.  During the past five years, we invested $86 million in manufacturing and quality assurance equipment to further bolster our position for the long run.   Supporting a successful and diversified product line is a commitment to financial flexibility and strength. Atrion maintains a steady and consistent focus on managing assets wisely, making products that meet specific market needs, and improving productivity and profitability. As a result, we have delivered consistent growth in earnings per share from continuing operations, while funding the needs of the business and investing in the resources, technology and assets to ensure operating efficiency and fuel future growth.   Atrion has approximately 400,000 square feet of manufacturing, research and development capacity in three facilities in Alabama, Florida and Texas. We continually upgrade the manufacturing technology in our plants  automating processes where possible to maximize efficiency and quality control. The result is a seamless development and production system that can respond to new and increasing customer demand.  Atrion is committed to creating continuing value for stockholders. In recent years, the company has completed several stock repurchase programs, aimed at enhancing stockholder value. Since 2003, when we initiated the payment of quarterly dividends on our common stock, we have increased the dividend seventeen times.  In August 2020, we boosted the quarterly dividend from $1.55 per share to $1.75 per share.    The development of new products to meet market needs is an ongoing strategy of the companys, Atrion has developed a line of swabable valve products that minimizes the risk of needle-sticks for medical personnel, and the MPS®3, the third generation of our Myocardial Protection System. The MPS®3 is a proprietary technology that delivers essential fluids and medications to the heart during open-heart surgery providing increased flexibility to the surgeon and enhanced safety to the patient.  Our companys goal is to continue to build its presence in the medical products industry by leveraging our leadership position in niche markets and by developing new products to meet increasing customer demand for effectiveness, safety and cost.

(“Antares”). Antares is committed to protecting the privacy of users of this website located at www.antarespharma.com or any website owned, operated, licensed or controlled by us (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy describes how we gather and use information about visitors to our Site (“Visitors”). This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information that we collect through the Site. This Privacy Policy does not address personal information that you provide to us in other contexts (e.g., through a business relationship not handled through the Site). Acceptance of Privacy Policy By using the Site, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept those changes. I. Information We Collect We may have access to the following categories of Personal Information regarding you and your visit to our website. Only some categories of information identify you directly, but each category offers some information about your interests and activities that could be used to make inferences about you. Personal Information That You Voluntarily Provide  Site Registration. We have constructed this Site so that you may visit and review information about the services/products we offer without revealing your identity or volunteering any Personal Information. If you register to use the website’s features and services, either as a consumer or a health care professional, we will collect “Personal Information” from you. “Personal Information” means information that identifies you or could reasonably be used to identify you. Examples of Personal Information include your name, company name, mailing address, phone number, and/or email address. When this information is combined with any information on health or medical status (pursuant to all applicable laws), we refer to the resulting information as “Health-related Personal Information.” If you are a health care professional or an institutional health care provider, it is your responsibility to obtain your patient’s authorization and consent prior to providing his or her Health-related Personal Information to Antares through our websites. By submitting any such information, you represent and warrant that you have obtained your patient’s authorization to do so. Interactive Services. Antares collects information through various points of contact, including questionnaires, surveys, HR link, Contact Us link, business development inquiries and Antares’ Co-pay Support Programs where visitors may provide certain Personal Information in order to obtain co-pay assistance cards. If you choose to participate in our interactive services, you may disclose Personal Information as well as Health-related Personal Information that could be used to identify you or your family members. Providers who use our benchmarking services and quality of care assessments may choose to disclose facts about their practice and patients that include extremely sensitive, personal data. Correspondence with Antares. You may use our site to ask questions or report problems regarding our products and/or services to health care professionals hired by Antares to address consumers’ and health care professionals’ questions regarding use of our products and/or services. If you communicate with or request information from Antares personnel, they will have your Personal Information such as your e-mail address, as well as whatever health-related and/or personal facts you choose to include in your e-mail. If you are reporting a product experience, we may ask you for specific facts, including patient initials, age gender, and prescribing physician. U.S. regulations require us to collect patient-identifiable information in order to file reports with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regarding the safety of our products.  Information That Is Routinely Collected By Our Site Technology:  IP Address. Each time you comes to the Site, Antares collects some information to improve the overall quality of your online experience. We record the Internet Protocol (“IP”) address of your computer when you visit our site. An IP address is a number that automatically identifies the computer or device you have used to access the Internet. Without more, the IP address does not identify you personally, but it is what allows us to maintain communications with your computer as you move about our site. Cookies and Other Technologies. We also collect information about your use of our site through technology such as cookies and web beacons. A “web beacon” is a piece of code on our site that enables us to monitor things like user activity and site traffic. Some web beacons may be unusable if you elect to reject their associated cookies. A “cookie” is a unique numeric code that we transfer to your computer so that we can keep track of your interests and preferences and recognize you as a return visitor to our site. Cookie technology allows us to collect “clickstream” data, which is not Personal Information, but which reflects your activities on the site, including your interest in certain health care conditions. A cookie does not collect or keep your name or other personal identifying information, but when you revisit our site the cookie allows us to bring you the content and features likely to be of greatest interest to you based on your previous activities on our site. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. Third-Party Advertising. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on other websites. These companies may use information (not including your name, e-mail, address, or telephone number) obtained from cookies and web beacons about your visits to this site and other websites in order to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.  II. How We Use Your Information Whether you are a consumer or a health care professional, we use the information about your use of the services and activities on our website to monitor user traffic patterns and try to analyze what our users prefer so that we can design better services. The Personal Information and Health-related Personal Information that you provide may be used to create customized offers, information, and services tailored to your interests and preferences. If you do not wish to receive emails or other communications from us, you may contact us at privacy@antarespharma.com and request that your Personal Information be removed from our list. Personal Information. We will only use your Personal Information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Information in the following circumstances:  To perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you. To fulfill our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. To comply with a legal obligation. To contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an unexpected event involving use of our product. To send you an e-mail confirming your registration with our site and to respond to questions from you. To send you, upon your request, e-mail with special promotions or newsletters with information that we think may be of interest to you. To personalize content provided on the website. To customize your site experience by anticipating the information and services that may be of interest to you. To improve the functioning of our site. To fulfill business purposes, including operation of our site, as well as research and product analyses to help us better market our products.  Health-related Personal Information. If you choose to participate in our interactive services, we will collect the information you choose to disclose and use it in the following circumstances:  To discover new facts that could help us better understand how our products are used in coping with the diseases for which they are marketed. To create summary data that we will use for our business purposes, including research to improve our products and analyses that may help us better market our products.  We may offer interactive services that ask you to furnish Health-related Personal Information about you, your family members, or, if you are a health care provider, your patients. The information you disclose and provide in interactive services may be linked (pursuant to all applicable laws) with the Personal Information you may choose to provide elsewhere on our site and together this may provide us with Personal Information about your health and health care. If you submit health-related personal information through our website to participate in a clinical trial, we may use that information to assess whether you qualify for enrollment in the trial, to contact you about potential participation in the trial, and to provide you with additional information about the trial. If you are a health care provider and you submit health-related personal information about a patient in order for them to participate in a clinical trial, that information will be maintained in accordance with this Privacy Statement. If we determine that your patient is eligible for the trial, we will use the information you submit to contact you about your patient’s potential participation in the trial and to provide you with additional information.

Disclosure and Relationship To Third Parties Antares will not sell, rent, license, or trade any Personal Information or Health-related Personal Information you provide on our site to an unrelated third party without your express permission, except as explained in this Privacy Statement. If we allow a third party contractor to have access to your Personal Information or health-related personal information, we will not authorize them to take it or use it for any purpose that is not consistent with this Privacy Statement.  Third Parties Assisting In Our Operations. Antares may share your Personal Information under confidentiality agreements with other companies that work with, or on behalf of, Antares to provide products and services. These companies may use your Personal Information to assist Antares in its operations. We will not authorize our vendors and suppliers to use your personally identifiable information for any purpose not related to Antares’s business operation. Co-branded Sites. We will partner with other companies to provide you with content or services on a joint or “co-branded” basis. At a co-branded site you will see both the Antares logo and the logo of the co-branded partner displayed on your screen. To access the services available on a co-branded site you may have to complete a new on-line registration form, and this registration information may be shared with Antares’s co-branded partners. You should read the individual privacy policies of our co-branded partners, as these may differ in some respects from ours. Reading these policies will help you to make an informed decision about whether to provide your information to a given site. Remember, you may always opt-out of sharing your information with a partner site by choosing not to use the service or content provided by the co-branded site.  Advertisers. We do not permit advertisers to display their advertisements at our site. Disclosure to Subsequent Owner or Operator. We may share your Personal Information with other business entities in connection with the sale, assignment, merger or other transfer of all or a portion of Antares’ business to such business entity. We will try to assure that no personally identifiable information that is transferred will be used or shared in a manner inconsistent with this Statement without your consent. However, in the event of a sale or merger, your continued use of this site signifies your agreement to be bound by the privacy statement and other applicable terms of the subsequent owner or operator.  IV. Our Security Measures The security of your data is very important to Antares. We have implemented appropriate security measures, including encryption practices, to prevent your Personal Information and Health-related Personal Information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. All personal and/or health-related personal information is kept physically behind firewalls that prevent intruders from gaining access. As an added security precaution, we deploy various methods of protection such as host intrusion prevention and detection systems to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of data. However, you should know that no web site operator, including Antares, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Information. While Antares has endeavored to create a secure and reliable website for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from the Site or via e-mail cannot be guaranteed. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected Personal Information breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. V. Links to Other Sites The Site may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that Antares is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. When you connect to a website that is linked to our Site, we encourage you to read the privacy statements of that website. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Antares. VI. Response to “Do Not Track” Signals Some Internet browsers include the ability to transmit “Do Not Track” signals. Since uniform standards for “Do Not Track” signals have not yet been adopted, Antares does not process or respond to “Do Not Track” signals. VII. Our Children’s Policy             Under Age 13 Antares understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive online world. The Site is not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children under 13 years of age. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13. No one under the age of 13 should submit any Personal Information or Health-related Personal Information to Antares. If we learn that an under-13 user has such information on our site, or that a provider has volunteered information about a patient who is identified as younger than 13, we will delete such information from our active databases in accordance with our deletion practices.             Under Age 18 Minors under 18 years of age may have the Personal Information that they have provided to Antares through the Site deleted by sending an email to privacy@antarespharma.com requesting deletion. Please note that, while we make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all systems. VIII. Deletion Practices Upon receiving your request, Antares will delete all of your Personal and/or Health-related Personal Information stored in the databases Antares actively uses for research and daily business activities, or otherwise stored in readily searchable media. In addition, we will use commercially reasonable efforts not to disclose any personal information stored in a non-erasable format after receiving your request for removal, except as required by law. Nevertheless, Site users should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove from our servers each and every record of the information you have provided to Antares. The information that you provide Antares is stored in servers that are operated and maintained by Antares and third parties under contract with Antares. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of information about you or your health-related interests may exist in non-erasable forms that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Please be aware that Antares may not comply with a consumer’s request to amend or remove information that was provided to Antares by a health care professional or a consumer regarding an adverse drug event. IX. California Consumer Privacy Act If you are a California resident, California law provides you with the following rights with respect to your Personal Information:  The right to know what personal information we have collected, used, disclosed and sold about you. To submit a request to know, you may contact us at (877) 225-2908 or privacy@antarespharma.com. You also may designate an authorized agent to make a request for access on your behalf. The right to request that we delete any personal information we have collected about you. To submit a request for deletion, you may you may contact us at (877) 225-2908 or privacy@antarespharma.com. You also may designate an authorized agent to make a request for deletion on your behalf.  When you exercise these rights and submit a request to us, we will verify your identity by asking you to log in to your account if you have one with us. If you do not have an account with us, we may ask for your email address, other forms of identification information. We also may use a third party verification provider to verify your identity. Your exercise of these rights will have no adverse effect on the price and quality of our services. Antares will not sell your Personal Information or Health-related Personal Information. X. Changes In Our Privacy Statement We reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Statement at any time by posting revisions to our site. If at any point, we decide to use personally identifiable information or health-related personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, you will be given a choice to allow or disallow any additional uses or disclosures of your personally identifiable information or health-related personal information. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, or about the use, amendment, or deletion of Personal Information that you have provided to us, please contact us at privacy@antarespharma.com.  ​​        ","",""

We believe these market characteristics offer                         the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns on apartment community                         investment relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics.                                                  As of March 31, 2021, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 290 apartment communities containing 85,787 apartment homes in 11 states and the District of Columbia, of which 15 communities were under development and one community was under redevelopment.

AVEO’s strategy is to focus its resources toward development and commercialization of its product candidates in North America, while leveraging partnerships to support development and commercialization in other geographies. AVEO’s lead candidate, FOTIVDA® (tivozanib), received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in March 2021 for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) following two or more prior systemic therapies. FOTIVDA was approved in August 2017 in the European Union and other countries in the territory of its partner EUSA Pharma for the treatment of adult patients with advanced RCC. AVEO has previously reported promising early clinical data on ficlatuzumab (Anti-HGF/c-MET IgG1 mAb) in head and neck cancer, acute myeloid leukemia and pancreatic cancer and is conducting a randomized Phase 2 confirmatory clinical trial of ficlatuzumab in head and neck cancer. AVEO’s earlier-stage pipeline includes several monoclonal antibodies in oncology development, including AV-203 (Anti-ERBB3 mAb), AV-380 (Anti-GDF15 IgG1mAb) and AV-353 (Anti-Notch 3 mAb). AVEO is committed to creating an environment of diversity and inclusion as a foundation for innovation. Ficlatuzumab, AV-203, AV-380 and AV-353 are investigational drugs and have not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
