Since its founding in 2008, Acasti Pharma has focused on addressing a critical market need for an effective, safe and well-absorbing omega-3 therapeutic that can make a positive impact on the major blood lipids associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Acasti conducted two Phase 3 clinical trials: the TRILOGY trials. In TRILOGY 1, CaPre® achieved a 30.5% reduction in triglyceride levels at 12 weeks and 36.7% reduction in triglyceride levels at 26 weeks, as well as 42.2% reduction in triglyceride levels among patients receiving CaPre while on background statin therapy at 12 weeks. Despite positive results in the CaPre arm, the TRILOGY 1 study did not reach statistical significance. In TRILOGY 2, CaPre achieved 30.4% median reduction in triglycerides at 12 weeks and 38.4% at 26 weeks, but did not achieve statistical significance for the primary endpoint.

(""the Company"") is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of a therapeutic agent for the treatment of alcohol use disorder (""AUD"") using its lead investigational new drug product, AD04, a selective serotonin-3 antagonist (i.e., a ""5-HT3 antagonist""). The active ingredient in AD04 is ondansetron, the active ingredient in Zofran®, an approved drug for treating nausea and emesis. AUD is characterized by an urge to consume alcohol and an inability to control the levels of consumption. AD04 is currently being investigated in a Phase 3 clinical for the potential treatment of AUD in subjects with certain target genotypes, which are to be identified using the Company’s proprietary companion diagnostic genetic test. The Company believes this approach is unique in that it targets the serotonin system and individualizes the treatment of AUD, through the use of genetic screening. The Company has created an investigational companion diagnostic biomarker test for the genetic screening of patients with certain biomarkers that, as reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry (Johnson, et. al. 2011 & 2013), are believed will benefit from treatment with AD04. The Company's strategy is to integrate the pre-treatment genetic screening into AD04's label to create a patient-specific treatment in one integrated therapeutic offering. The Company's goal is to develop a genetically targeted, effective and safe product candidate to treat AUD that does not require abstinence as part of treatment.

These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but are based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and beliefs about our company and our industry. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of word or phrases such as ""believe,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" and ""would."" Statements throughout this website concerning future events depend on several factors beyond the company's control, including receipt of adequate funding to support these activities. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, one or more of which may cause our actual results to be materially different from the forward-looking statements contained throughout this website. Forward-looking statements contained on this website may include, but are not limited to, statements about our product candidates, research and development, strategies, objectives regulatory matters, markets, and future performance, future financial and operating results, the company's ability to obtain adequate funding to support its operations, the company's beliefs concerning the safety and effectiveness of its compounds and drug product candidates, the expected timing and outcome of future clinical trials of the company's product candidates, the expected timing and outcome of submissions to the FDA or other regulatory agencies for approvals to conduct clinical trials or for marketing approvals for our products, future revenues from sales of products, assuming that they are developed and approved for marketing by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, the current or future market sizes for the company's products, the extent of customer demand for the company's products, and the intellectual property protection that may be afforded by any patents or patent applications relating to the company's products, product candidates and technologies.

Additional risks not known to Adamis or that Adamis believes are immaterial may also adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.

Advantage’s data and technology-enabled omnichannel solutions — including sales, retail merchandising, business intelligence, digital commerce and a full suite of marketing services — help brands and retailers across a broad range of channels drive consumer demand, increase sales and achieve operating efficiencies. Headquartered in Irvine, California, Advantage has offices throughout North America and strategic investments in select markets throughout Africa, Asia, Australia and Europe through which it services the global needs of multinational, regional and local manufacturers.    Shareholder Letter   Dear Advantage shareholders, 2020 was a year unlike any I can remember. The human and economic suffering the year inflicted is heartbreaking. However, I’m proud of the way people all over the world came together to help fight through the COVID-19 pandemic. And I’m grateful Advantage was able to play a significant part in helping our communities get through these challenging times — working to ensure food and essential goods were available despite strained supply chains and record at-home demand. No other time so clearly illustrates how mission critical our services are to brands and retailers. We were an invaluable partner from the first days of the pandemic, ensuring products were available to consumers in-store and online, and using our nimble platform to meet retailer labor shortages and stand up e-commerce offerings. I’d like to thank all of our front-line workers who so selflessly serve. Your passion and dedication to your communities is inspiring and a light of hope for all to see.  The year brought tumultuous and disruptive change — change that we helped our clients navigate. For clients serving consumers at home, that meant responding to an unprecedented demand boom. For clients serving consumers away from home, that meant weathering an unprecedented demand bust. And for all, it meant reaching consumers through new channels and means. 2020 has surely taught us the world is a dynamic place and we do not proclaim to know what the future holds. However, we do know we have the capabilities, team and culture to meet that future, whatever it may bring, and emerge stronger. To be successful in this dynamic environment, we must help brands and retailers create value. We do this with practical, client-driven innovation and a healthy dissatisfaction with the status quo. Our strategy is simple. We plan to continue doing what we have been doing for decades — serving clients well while running an efficient operation and prudently reinvesting in capabilities to meet clients' evolving needs. We invest to help clients win, innovate to help clients win and acquire to help clients win.  Because that’s how we win. It's a formula that's proven itself worthy over time and we believe gives us ample runway to create value for public shareholders in the future. Since this is our first annual report as a public company, I’d like to express how happy I am to welcome you as a new shareholder of Advantage. We appreciate your decision to become an owner of our company. As we continue to build the business on your behalf, we will remain laser-focused on our mission to create sustainable shareholder value for you over time. After over 30 years as a private company, we still very much think of our owners as partners in the business. Much like I’ve done in the past with our private owners, my goal will be to provide you with a realistic assessment of our business opportunities and challenges. Owners should expect no less. Our team takes great pride and responsibility in the trust you’ve placed in us to be to be good stewards of your capital. We look forward to having you as part of the Advantage family for many years. In this letter, I’ll share how Advantage creates value. I’ll also review the progress we made in 2020 and highlight some of our key priorities for 2021 and beyond. Now, to the main event. What do you own and how do we create value? As an Advantage shareholder, you own a stake in the leading provider of outsourced solutions to consumer goods companies and retailers. We have a strong platform of competitively advantaged sales and marketing services built over multiple decades — business critical services like headquarter sales, retail merchandising, in-store sampling, digital commerce and shopper marketing. For brands and retailers of all sizes, we help get the right products on the shelf (whether physical or digital) and into the hands of consumers (however they shop). We innovate in partnership with our clients, solving problems to boost efficiency and effectiveness. Creating value on this platform is simple, but not easy. At the most fundamental level: We sit at the nexus of consumer goods companies and retailers. A trusted partner to both. We help our clients sell more while spending less. We make them more effective. And more efficient. We win by providing best-in-class service every day. And by innovating on a nimble operating platform. We drive productivity to provide fuel for reinvestment and growth. Simply put, we are built to do it better, cheaper and faster. At our leading scale, this stable model yields solid EBITDA margins, which we convert into abundant free cash flow. We then reinvest that free cash flow at very attractive incremental returns and drive growth by selling more asset-light core services to our existing clients, recruiting new clients and entering adjacent spaces where we have the right to win, further widening our competitive moat. Our expertise and scale have compounded over decades, built on differentiated business systems, talent, relationships and technology. We listen, learn and invest in capabilities that allow us to meet the evolving needs of brands and retailers — solving existing problems better and new problems quickly to navigate change in an increasingly omnichannel world. This, in turn, helps us compound our relationships with clients. Over time, our clients outsource more. As a trusted partner, we capture an outsized share of that outsourcing. By layering on new solutions as we go, we add rich data and insights atop a scaled team and seek to expand returns on capital while outgrowing our end markets. Our marketing business is a great example of these principles in action. This business started a couple decades ago with a simple observation: As the sales agency for brands, we saw that marketing agencies were often not effectively building our clients’ businesses. We realized we had unique insights and data from our sales role and could more effectively create winning marketing strategies for brands by successfully integrating with sales plans at retailers. And we won. It was the same eye for opportunity and practical innovation that led us to professionalize retailers’ in-store sampling programs, bringing compliance, safety and strategy to a valuable tactic that delivers value to brands and retailers by allowing them to surprise and delight consumers. Today, our marketing segment is greater than $1 billion in revenue. And we haven’t stopped. With this in mind, how do we measure value creation? How we’ll measure performance We are a team who wants to win and knows how to win for clients and shareholders. We believe the primary measure of our success will be the sustainable long-term value we create for shareholders over time (on a per share basis). While not a perfect measure, we believe long-term total shareholder returns is a reasonable system for keeping score. This reflects our belief that public equity markets “get it right” and reflect intrinsic business value reasonably well over time. We’re confident, however, that if we do our jobs well and compound the intrinsic value of our business by executing well and investing wisely, our stock performance should be aligned in the long run. To measure our progress, we use metrics that are linked to long-term value creation. Two important measures in this mosaic are revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth over time. As shown below, we’ve compounded growth at 2x our underlying end markets organically and >3x in total. This track record highlights the powerful compounding capabilities of our platform.     2020 – A year like no other With the onset of COVID, the speed of change around the world across industries was staggering. We all reacted quickly to protect the health and safety of ourselves and others. The rules by which we were used to living and working went out the window. When the dust settled, things looked quite different. There were winners, there were losers, and the world seemed to bifurcate. During the pandemic we’ve seen unprecedent demand growth for at-home consumption and experiences. This created winners. Brands, retailers and platforms supporting this at-home economy have done quite well. On the other end, we saw an unprecedented decline in away-from-home consumption and experiences. This created losers. Brands, retailers and restaurants built around reaching consumers on-the-go have struggled mightily. Platforms built around live experiences have been suspended. We were not immune. We had both winners and losers in the COVID world.   The COVID winners were mostly in our Sales segment, which represented approximately half of our business on a pre-COVID basis and finished 2020 with 5% revenue growth, despite weathering headwinds in the segment’s smaller food service and international businesses. Here, our headquarter sales and retail merchandising businesses have never been busier. Our teams have been critical partners to brands and retailers seeking to meet unprecedented consumer demand in traditional retail and e-commerce channels, making sure products are available for consumers at the shelf and online. The COVID losers were mostly in our Marketing segment, which represented approximately half of our business on a pre-COVID basis and finished 2020 with a 40% revenue decline. Here, our large in-store sampling business experienced temporary headwinds after the suspension and reduction of in-person events at our retailer partners’ stores. Despite a strong desire from retailers and brands to bring these programs back to stores as soon as safe and possible, our business remained in hibernation for most of the year — only beginning to reemerge in a measured way in the third quarter. We do expect this business to get back to its winning ways as soon as the state of health and policy allow. However, we are resilient. Our platform is nimble and our team is battle-tested. We were able to quickly implement cost controls and realign resources to embrace the new operating reality and mitigate headwinds from COVID-challenged services. And we got to work helping brands and retailers solve new problems presented by the pandemic. We scaled important digital and e-commerce solutions to help brands and retailers reach consumers who were shopping more online. And we launched new service innovations to help brands and retailers surprise and delight consumers with safe experiences through virtual events and online pickup and delivery sample bags. The result? Adjusted EBITDA declined only 3% in 2020, despite a 17% decline in revenues. We’re confident our business will emerge from COVID better and stronger than before. Our team’s innovation not only helped mitigate COVID-related headwinds in the near term, but also laid the foundation for durable new businesses to grow upon in the future. The trust we built with brands and retailers in 2020 by executing well in these challenging times and going above and beyond the normal call of duty to help them solve problems should pay dividends in the future. That leads me to my next topic. What the future may hold: 2021 and beyond We believe our future is bright at Advantage. Our business is better positioned now than at any other time during my over 30 years with the company. We’ve reinforced client relationships and trust and fortified our solutions with practical, timely innovations.  The value proposition supporting demand for our critical services remains as strong as ever. We’ve built leading market share and competitive advantages in key businesses across our sales and marketing segments. One of the things I have always most appreciated about our business is that our platform gives us endless opportunity to evolve and grow. We have multiple opportunities for value-creating growth through both organic and tuck-in acquisition initiatives.   Buoyed by the stable underlying growth in the consumer goods end market we serve, we expect additional tailwinds over the next couple of years from: a recovery from temporary COVID softness in portions of our business tied to in-person shopping, accelerated omnichannel service adoption during COVID that we believe likely sticks and continues to grow (e.g., online pickup and delivery sampling), and growth and adoption of our innovative digital and e-commerce solutions. Despite still not knowing the exact shape a recovery will take because of the uncertainty that remains around the virus, vaccine rollout and timing of the economy reopening, we believe we are well positioned and win under multiple recovery scenarios. Our nimble, asset-light platform affords us the flexibility to adapt and best position the business to weather near-term headwinds and capture long-term tailwinds as the recovery evolves. We’re excited about the opportunities we have to help brands and retailers navigate change coming out of this pandemic. Because we are a critical partner connecting brands and retailers, we benefit from a unique vantage and informational advantages that allow us to better understand where pain points exist in the evolving value chain. This allows us to build solutions that are more effective and efficient in reaching consumers. We serve as a navigator. A sounding board. We’re helping clients position their businesses to win in a post-COVID world. This includes developing and executing strategies that allow clients to successfully navigate challenges in areas such as pricing, promotion, innovation, e-commerce, product demonstrations, private label, supply chain, food service and retail media. We’ve got our work cut out for us in 2021. But that’s what excites us. New industry challenges are the sparks that ignite new solutions — to make us a more valuable partner and platform. I’d be remiss after a year like 2020 not to mention a topic so critical to our society and future — ESG.  Environmental (E), social (S) and governance (G) issues have long been important at Advantage. It’s in our nature, for example, to strive to be more efficient with the resources we deploy, field the most talented and diverse team, and design governance with the interests of owners at heart. We understand we all must do more, though. You will hear more from us on this important topic in the future. We’re excited and committed to helping lead on these important topics. Our commitment to you is to make decisions and build the business with long-term value creation principles in mind — always letting clients’ needs serve as the true north that guides our actions and investment. By being good stewards of our clients' businesses and our owners' capital, the results should take care of themselves over time. We thank you for your investment and continued support.

Unless otherwise noted, Advantage is providing this information as of the date of this letter to shareholders and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA means net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net, (ii) (benefit from) provision for income taxes, (iii) depreciation, (iv) impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets, (v) amortization of intangible assets, (vi) Advantage Sponsors’ management fees and equity-based compensation expense, (vii) fair value adjustments of contingent consideration related to acquisitions, (viii) acquisition-related expenses, (ix) costs associated with COVID-19, net of benefits received, (x) EBITDA for economic interests in investments, (xi) restructuring expenses, (xii) litigation expenses, (xiii) (Recovery from) loss on Take 5, (xiv) costs associated with the Take 5 Matter and (xv) other adjustments that management believes are helpful in evaluating our operating performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA because it is a key operating measure used by us to assess our financial performance. This measure adjusts for items that we believe do not reflect the ongoing operating performance of our business, such as certain noncash items, unusual or infrequent items or items that change from period to period without any material relevance to our operating performance. We evaluate this measure in conjunction with our results according to GAAP because we believe it provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than GAAP measures alone. Furthermore, the agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants and other tests based on measures substantially similar to Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative for our net income (loss), our most directly comparable measure presented on a GAAP basis.                         News Releases                May 10, 2021       Advantage Solutions Reports Strong First Quarter 2021 Financial Results and Affirms 2021 Outlook           May 07, 2021       Advantage Solutions Announces Response to SEC Guidance Issued on April 12, 2021 Applicable to Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies           May 06, 2021       Advantage Solutions to Participate at Upcoming Investor Conferences                         Events                                           Jun 3, 2021 at 1:20 PM EDT               Advantage Solutions at RBC Consumer and Retail Conference     Click here for webcast                                       May 20, 2021 at 1:30 PM EDT               Advantage Solutions at Morgan Stanley Life After Covid: 2021 Thematic Conference     Click here for webcast                                       May 18, 2021 at 2:40 PM EDT               Advantage Solutions at Goldman Sachs Global Staples Forum     Click here for webcast                    Stock Quote      Change Volume 52 Week High 52 Week Low May 27, 2021 1:50 PM EDT           Stock Chart              Data Provided by Refinitiv.

To augment the body's natural immune defenses, the Aethlon Hemopurifier® reduces the presence of circulating viruses in infected individuals. The technology provides a first-line candidate defense against viruses that are not addressed with proven drug therapies, including natural occurring pandemic threats and agents of bioterrorism. The Hemopurifier® can also be deployed as a strategy to improve the benefit of approved antiviral drug regimens. At present, the Hemopurifier® is being advanced in the United States under an FDA approved clinical study. Aethlon Medical is also investigating the potential use of the Hemopurifier® to reduce the presence of tumor-derived exosomes, which contribute to immune-suppression and the spread of metastasis in cancer patients. Aethlon Medical is also the majority owner of Exosome Sciences, Inc. (ESI), which is focused on the discovery of exosomal biomarkers to diagnose and monitor cancer and neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). ESI's TauSome™ biomarker is being clinically evaluated as the basis for a blood-based test to identify CTE in living individuals.        Download            Leadership Our people are our backbone.

Our Investment Approach Our core portfolio is located in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern United States and is structured to take advantage of densely populated, high barrier-to-entry and supply-constrained markets. Furthermore, the majority of our properties are anchored by necessity and discount/value retailers and thus less dependent on discretionary consumer spending. We also operate through a series of opportunity funds, through which we, as the general partner/member, together with institutional investors, invest in both opportunistic and value-add acquisitions. We are well-positioned to take advantage of profitable opportunities for growth. Our strengths include an experienced management team with a proven track record and a portfolio of high-quality retail properties.

Until more data are available, Akari Therapeutics is not considering requests for expanded access outside of clinical trials. This policy may change as safety and efficacy are better demonstrated.

Minimum 15 minutes delayed.                            Investor Relations                   Corporate Profile  Akouos is a precision genetic medicine company dedicated to developing gene therapies with the potential to restore, improve, and preserve high-acuity physiologic hearing for people worldwide who live with disabling hearing loss. Leveraging its precision genetic medicine platform that incorporates a proprietary adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector library and a novel delivery approach, Akouos is focused on developing precision therapies for forms of sensorineural hearing loss. The Company’s lead product candidate, AK-OTOF, is a gene therapy for the treatment of hearing loss due to mutations in the OTOF gene. Additional pipeline programs span across multiple inner ear disorders, and include CLRN1 for Usher Type 3A, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive loss of both hearing and vision; GJB2 for a common form of monogenic deafness and hearing loss; and delivery of an anti-VEGF, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, a protein that can cause abnormal blood vessel growth, for the treatment of vestibular schwannoma, a tumor of the auditory vestibular nerve.

Our proprietary Variant Immunoglobulin Domain™ (“vIgD™”) scientific platform uses a process known as directed evolution to create therapeutics potentially capable of modulating human immune system proteins. Our vIgD platform creates molecules which can be formatted in many different ways, including standard Fc fusion proteins, localized Fc fusion proteins, and monoclonal antibody fusion proteins as well as formulated as a Transmembrane Immunomodulatory Protein (“TIP™”) or as a Secreted Immunomodulatory Protein (“SIP™”). We completed enrollment in the first human clinical trial of ALPN-101, our first-in-class dual CD28/ICOS antagonist in October 2019. ‘BALANCE’, a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial in acute GVHD is expected to begin enrollment in 2020. ALPN-202, our conditional CD28 costimulator and dual checkpoint inhibitor, is expected to begin Phase 1 trials in cancer patients in 2020.
